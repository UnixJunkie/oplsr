(** [(nb_comp_opt, r2) = optimize debug nprocs train_csv_fn nb_folds ncomp_max]
    Optimize a Partial Least Square (PLS) model.
    Especially, the optimal number of components is found,
    as well as the corresponding R^2 (a model regression performance metric
    in [0:1]; near zero is dangerous, near one is good).
    [debug] is a verbosity flag.
    [nprocs] is the maximum number of parallel jobs.
    [train_csv_fn] is the name of the CSV file holding your data.
    This file must have the value to model in the first column (Y),
    all other columns are feature values (X_i).
    This file must be in space-separated dense format.
    Its first line is a CSV header (column numbers are fine).
    [nb_folds] is the number of folds of cross validation;
    five or ten is standard for this one.
    ([nb_folds] > 1) is mandatory.
    [ncomp_max] maximum number of components to consider
    (1 <= [ncomp_max] <= ndims). *)
val optimize: bool -> int -> string -> int -> int -> int * float

(** [trained_model_fn = train debug train_csv_fn nb_comp_opt]
    train a model using the given (optimal) number of components.
    The filename where the model is stored is returned. *)
val train: bool -> string -> int -> string

(** [predictions = \
    predict debug nb_comp_opt trained_model_fn test_csv_fn]
    predict using a trained model stored in [trained_model_fn],
    given the optimal number of components [nb_comp_opt], reading
    data to predict from [test_csv_fn].
    The raw list of predicted values is returned. *)
val predict: bool -> int -> string -> string -> float list

(** [predict_to_file debug nb_comp_opt trained_model_fn test_csv_fn output_fn]
    predict using a trained model stored in [trained_model_fn],
    given the optimal number of components [nb_comp_opt], reading
    data to predict from [test_csv_fn] and writing predictions to
    [output_fn]. *)
val predict_to_file: bool -> int -> string -> string -> string -> unit

(** [coefs = extract_coefs debug trained_model_fn]
    extract the coefficients from the trained model stored in
    [trained_model_fn]. *)
val extract_coefs: bool -> string -> float list
